Use some small n value for the matrices, example n = 5

Find some way of representing these these matrices as graphs

Count total edges on the graphs
(possibly look at euler characteristic to find these)

Overload the \< operator in order to have A<B for some matrix A,B 

So if A has 4 edges and B has 5 edges then A<B as 4<5 

Decide what to do in case of A=4 and B=4 but graph is not the same

Then choose a sorting algorithm (not bubble sort or merge sort)
Might try quicksort using a pushdown stack
