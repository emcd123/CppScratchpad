Use some small n value for the matrices, example n = 5 , done!

Find some way of representing these these matrices as graphs , done!

Dont bother storing them in files, just create the random matrices as im doing and store them in a fixed size array, done!

All my matrices are the same ,need to randomise , done!

Count total edges on the graphs
(look at euler characteristic to find these)

Overload the \< operator in order to have A<B for some matrix A,B

So if A has 4 edges and B has 5 edges then A<B as 4<5

Decide what to do in case of A=4 and B=4 but graph is not the same

Then choose a sorting algorithm (not bubble sort or merge sort)
Might try quicksort using a pushdown stack
